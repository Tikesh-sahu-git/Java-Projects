# Address Book Application (Java)

A console-based **Address Book** written in Java that allows you to manage contacts efficiently.  
Contacts are stored locally using Java serialization, so your data is preserved between sessions.

---

## Features

- Add new contacts (Name, Phone, Email, Address, Birthday, Notes)  
- View all contacts (sorted alphabetically)  
- Search contacts by **Name**, **Phone**, or **Email**  
- Edit existing contacts (update individual fields)  
- Delete contacts with confirmation  
- Save and exit (data stored in a `.dat` file)  
- Automatically load saved contacts on startup  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java SE 8+**  
- **Collections Framework** (`HashMap`, `Comparator`)  
- **Java Time API** (`LocalDate`, `DateTimeFormatter`)  
- **Object Serialization** for data persistence

## Possible Improvements

We have several ideas for enhancing the functionality and user experience of this project in the future:

- **Export/Import Contacts:**  
  - Export contact data to CSV or JSON for backup or sharing.  
  - Import contacts from CSV or JSON files for easy migration.  

- **Categories or Groups:**  
  - Organize contacts into groups (e.g., Work, Family, Friends).  

- **GUI Version (Swing or JavaFX):**  
  - Develop a graphical user interface for easier and more interactive contact management.  
  - See [Oracle Docs on Swing to JavaFX migration](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/swing/port-to-javafx.htm).  

- **Validation:**  
  - Add strong validation for Indian mobile numbers, PIN codes, and email formats.
